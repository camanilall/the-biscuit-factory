<h1> The Biscuit Factory </h1>

(Insert screen shot from ami.responsive website)

<h2> What is the purpose? </h2>
The Biscuit Factory website was created to attract new customers to a new vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free bakery in Notting Hill.

The aim is to give customers who have food intolerances an opportunity to have similiar baked goods to what you would find in a high quality bakery in London. 

The website also details the price of the baked goods on offer this week to show that the goods are affordable and help promote the image of inclusivity in baking. 

The website also has all the key information needed for potential customers to access the shop including knowledge that hot/cold drinks are served, opening times and an interactive map to identify exactly where the store is located.

The website also gives users the opportunity to purchase vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free celebration cakes (via the form page). The gallery page gives users the opportunity to see examples of what has already been created for previous customers.

<h1> User Experience </h1>
The website was planning in 5 overlapping stages:

<ul>
  <li> Strategy Plane: combining design and business strategy; </li>
  <li> Scope Plane: user requirements; </li>
  <li> Structure Plane: understanding how the layout of the 3 pages; </li>
  <li> Skeleton Plane: wireframe creation; </li>
  <li> Surface Plane: font and colour choice to enhance website. </li>
 </ul>
  
<h1> Strategy Plane </h1>
 
<h2> Design Strategy </h2>
To create a website that immediately let's users know the purpose is to attract them to a  new vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free bakery.
 
Execution: this is shown through the choice of baked good colours (browns/yellow tones) and clear yellow banners on the Homepage to sign-post the user and entice them with a weekly offer.

<h2> Business Strategy </h2>
The target audience is users who suffer from either allergies or intolerances and want to purchase affordable baked goods as well as celebration cakes.

<h1> Structure Plane </h1>

The website is split into three key sections: the Homepage; the Cakes page; the Contact page.

<h2> Navigation </h2>

The Navigation bar sits across the all three pages and gives users the ability to flick easily between pages. This is through using the 'The Biscuit Factory' logo or the 'Home' icon which links back to the homepage aswell as the 'Cakes' and 'Contact' icons which link to the Cakes gallery and enquiry form respectively.

<h2> Footer </h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122119585/215328732-1ef9484d-6fb9-4057-9436-83032430c507.png)

The Footer bar sits across all three pages and gives the user key contact information, both a telephone number and e-mail. The footer also includes social media links to a Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages. Icons have been included from font awesome to make it immediately clear to the user the purpose of the footer and what each link will navigate to.
 
 <h2> Homepage </h2>

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122119585/215326073-18616e24-548b-4f1c-8b9f-4e2af2468cd9.png)
 
The image at the start of the homepage immediately triggers in the users mind that the website is about baked goods. The banners in yellow help to make clear to the user that the website is for 'London's Newest Vegan, Dairy-Free & Gluten-Free Bakery'. The offer in the top right hand corner is to entice users that they could save money visiting here and encourage them to scroll down.

<h2> Welcome & Opening Times </h2>

The Welcome banner in brown helps customers to understand that the Bakery is located in Notting Hill. The information box in yellow details the opening times and additional key information that the user would expect to be clarified in the website including whether pets are welcome and that there is a hot/cold drinks selection. The image on the right hand side is to show the user that what the look of the baked goods/drinks so they understand what to expect. The colour choice between the 'Welcome Box' and 'Opening Times & Key Information' is to highlight each section individually and break information into different sections to enhance user experience.

<h2> Weekly Specials </h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122119585/215327660-66cedf17-1357-47f2-8ede-cefc5928e6f4.png)

This gives customers an understanding of what is on offer on the menu this week with all the prices see if they are interested in any of the goods and they are in the customers' price range. The colour contrast between the rows is to increase readability of the table.

<h2> Customer Reviews & Map </h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122119585/215327901-fb782a6c-0ec4-41ad-8cb5-daae2ba6efec.png)

The two customers review encourage new customers to try the bakery as they re-iterate the idea that the bakery will be a positive experience. The Google map pin points exactly where the bakery is located answering a key user requirement.

<h2> Cakes Page </h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122119585/215329587-03713e43-60aa-4f94-9cee-66dc6f807dff.png)

The 'Bespoke Cake Creation' box gives users an introduction to the gallery below of previous cake creations. The enquiry form button in yellow easily navigates you to the form on the 'Contact' Page.

<h2> Contact Page </h2>

The form details all the relevant fields including name, number and e-mail and type of event to fill out to make an enquiry. Each field needs to be filled out to be able to submit. 

<h1> Skeleton Plane </h1>

To construct the website I firstly designed three wireframes attached below:

Wireframe 1 (add links)
Wireframe 2 (add links)
Wireframe 3 (add links)

<h1> Surface Plane </h1>

<h2> Colour Palette </h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122119585/215336740-2bcc0776-961f-480d-9cb2-c011960d63a2.png)

Colour 1: Hex Code #c79d33
Colour 2: Hex Code #b67f5f
Colour 3: Hex Code #dfc56d
Colour 4: Hex Code #faf2ed
Colour 5: Hex Code #020202

Colour 4 was the background of the website and the colours are supposed to represent the colour of baked goods to give a bakery feel to the page. I also used a shade of white with Hex Code #f5f5f5 for the font colour across the website to contrast with the background colours.

I used <a href=https://coolors.co/ target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Link to Coolors"> Coolors</a> to play around with different colour palettes to find shades I thought worked well together. 

<h2> Fonts </h2>

Fonts were found by Google Fonts, where Viga was used for headers and Sansita was used for the body of the text. These fonts work well together.

<h2> Logo </h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122119585/215339622-ad4e3c0a-a7a9-4fae-9db0-83c02b034e87.png)

The logo was created using a template from <a href=https://www.canva.com/ target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Link to Canva">Canva</a> The reason of including a logo was to give the website a more professional look.

<h1> Future Features</h1>

Future features I would include in the next sprint of the website design:
<ul>
<li> A new page titled 'Veganism' with an embedded video of the benefits of Veganism to help customers understand how switching to more vegan friendly purchases can help the environment. </li>
<li> A new page on 'Events' and detailing baking classes that the Biscuit Factory are going to hold.</li>
</ul>
