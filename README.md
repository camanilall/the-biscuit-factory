<h1> The Biscuit Factory </h1>

(Insert screen shot from ami.responsive website)

<h2> What is the purpose? </h2>
The Biscuit Factory website was created to attract new customers to a new vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free bakery in Notting Hill.

The aim is to give customers who have food intolerances an opportunity to have similiar baked goods to what you would find in a high quality bakery in 
London. 

The website also details the price of the baked goods on offer this week to show that the goods are affordable and help promote the image of inclusivity in baking. 

The website also has all the key information needed for potential customers to access the shop including knowledge that hot/cold drinks are served, opening times and an interactive map to identify exactly where the store is located.

The website also gives users the opportunity to purchase vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free celebration cakes (via the form page). The gallery page gives users the opportunity to see examples of what has already been created for previous customers.

  <li> Scope Plane: user requirements; </li>
  <li> Structure Plane: understanding how the layout of the 3 pages; </li>
  <li> Skeleton Plane: wireframe creation; </li>
  <li> Surface Plane: font and colour choice to enhance website. </li>
 </ul>

<h2> Design Strategy </h2>
To create a website that immediately let's users know the purpose is to attract them to a  new vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free bakery.

<h1> Structure Plane </h1>

The website is split into three key sections: the Homepage; the Cakes page; the Contact page.

<h2> Navigation </h2>

The Navigation bar sits across the all three pages and gives users the ability to flick easily between pages. This is through using the 'The Biscuit Factory' logo or the 'Home' icon which links back to the homepage aswell as the 'Cakes' and 'Contact' icons which link to the Cakes gallery and enquiry form respectively.

<h2> Footer </h2>

The Footer bar sits across all three pages and gives the user key contact information, both a telephone number and e-mail. The footer also includes social media links to a Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages. Icons have been included from font awesome to make it immediately clear to the user the purpose of the footer and what each link will navigate to.
 
 <h2> Homepage </h2>

The image at the start of the homepage immediately triggers in the users mind that the website is about baked goods. The banners in yellow help to make clear to the user that the website is for 'London's Newest Vegan, Dairy-Free & Gluten-Free Bakery'. The offer in the top right hand corner is to entice users that they could save money visiting here and encourage them to scroll down.

<h2> Welcome & Opening Times </h2>

The Welcome banner in brown helps customers to understand that the Bakery is located in Notting Hill. The information box in yellow details the opening times and additional key information that the user would expect to be clarified in the website including whether pets are welcome and that there is a hot/cold drinks selection. The image on the right hand side is to show the user that what the look of the baked goods/drinks so they understand what to expect. The colour choice between the 'Welcome Box' and 'Opening Times & Key Information' is to highlight each section individually and break information into different sections to enhance user experience.

<h2> Weekly Specials </h2>

This gives customers an understanding of what is on offer on the menu this week with all the prices see if they are interested in any of the goods and they are in the customers' price range. The colour contrast between the rows is to increase readability of the table.
