(Insert screen shot from ami.responsive website)

<h2> What is the purpose? </h2>
The Biscuit Factory website was created to attract new customers to a new vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free bakery in Notting Hill.

The aim is to give customers who have food intolerances an opportunity to have similiar baked goods to what you would find in a high quality bakery in 
London. 

The website also details the price of the baked goods on offer this week to show that the goods are affordable and help promote the image of inclusivity in baking. 

The website also has all the key information needed for potential customers to access the shop including knowledge that hot/cold drinks are served, opening times and an interactive map to identify exactly where the store is located.

The website also gives users the opportunity to purchase vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free celebration cakes (via the form page). The gallery page gives users the opportunity to see examples of what has already been created for previous customers.

  <li> Skeleton Plane: wireframe creation; </li>
  <li> Surface Plane: font and colour choice to enhance website. </li>
 </ul>

<h2> Design Strategy </h2>
To create a website that immediately let's users know the purpose is to attract them to a  new vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free bakery.

The target audience is users who suffer from either allergies or intolerances and want to purchase affordable baked goods as well as celebration cakes.
